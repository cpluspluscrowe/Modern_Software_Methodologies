   <strong>Agile methods and safety</strong> -- Agile methods are not usually used for safety&#9679;critical 
systems engineering
 Extensive process and product documentation is needed for 
system regulation. Contradicts the focus in agile methods on the 
software itself.
 A detailed safety analysis of a complete system specification is 
important. Contradicts the interleaved development of a system 
specification and program.

   <strong>Architectural design</strong> -- Two fundamental issues have to be considered when 
designing an architecture for security.
 Protection
• How should the system be organisedso that critical assets can be 
protected against external attack?
 Distribution
• How should system assets be distributed so that the effects of a 
successful attack are minimized?
These are potentially conflicting

uncover errors.
Concurrent systems can be analysed to discover race

problems is very difficult.

   <strong>Aspects of secure systems programming</strong> -- Vulnerabilities are often language&#9679;specific. 
 Array bound checking is automatic in languages like Java so this 
is not a vulnerability that can be exploited in Java programs. 
 However, millions of programs are written in C and C++ as these 
allow for the development of more efficient software so simply 
avoiding the use of these languages is not a realistic option.
Security vulnerabilities are closely related to program 
reliability. 
 Programs without array bound checking can crash so actions 
taken to improve program reliability can also improve system 
security.

   <strong>Balance security and usability</strong> --  Try to avoid security procedures that make the system difficult to 
use. Sometimes you have to accept weaker security to make the 
system more usable.
Log user actions
 Maintain a log of user actions that can be analyzed to discover 
who did what. If users know about such a log, they are less likely 
to behave in an irresponsible way.
Use redundancy and diversity to reduce risk
 Keep multiple copies of data and use diverse infrastructure so 
that an infrastructure vulnerability cannot be the single point of 
failure.

than one failure in security procedures. For example, have 
password and question&#9679;based authentication.

 When systems fail, for whatever reason, ensure that sensitive

 The static analyzer can check for patterns in the code that are 
characteristic of errors made by programmers using a particular 
language.
User&#9679;defined error checking
 Users of a programming language define error patterns, thus 
extending the types of error that can be detected. This allows

Assertion checking
 Developers include formal assertions in their program and 
relationships that must hold. The static analyzer symbolically

   <strong>Normal accidents</strong> -- Accidents in complex systems rarely have a single cause 
as these systems are designed to be resilient to a single 
point of failure
 Designing systems so that a single point of failure does not 
cause an accident is a fundamental principle of safe systems 
design.
Almost all accidents are a result of combinations of 
malfunctions rather than single failures.
It is probably the case that anticipating all problem 
combinations, especially, in software controlled systems 
is impossible so achieving complete safety is impossible.

access strategies that should apply across the 
organization. 
The point of security policies is to inform everyone in an 
organization about security so these should not be long 
and detailed technical documents. 
From a security engineering perspective, the security 
policy defines, in broad terms, the security goals of the 
organization. 
The security engineering process is concerned with 
implementing these goals.

   <strong>Safety terminology</strong> -- Term Definition
Accident (or mishap) An unplanned event or sequence of events which results in human death or injury,
damage to property, or to the environment. An overdose of insulin is an example of an
accident.
Hazard A condition with the potential for causing or contributing to an accident. A failure of the
sensor that measures blood glucose is an example of a hazard.
Damage A measure of the loss resulting from a mishap. Damage can range from many people
being killed as a result of an accident to minor injury or property damage. Damage
resulting from an overdose of insulin could be serious injury or the death of the user of
the insulin pump.
Hazard severity An assessment of the worst possible damage that could result from a particular hazard.
Hazard severity can range from catastrophic, where many people are killed, to minor,
where only minor damage results. When an individual death is a possibility, a
reasonable assessment of hazard severity is ‘very high’.
Hazard probability The probability of the events occurring which create a hazard. Probability values tend to
‘implausible’ (no conceivable situations are likely in which the hazard could occur). The
probability of a sensor failure in the insulin pump that results in an overdose is probably
low.
Risk This is a measure of the probability that the system will cause an accident. The risk is
assessed by considering the hazard probability, the hazard severity, and the probability
that the hazard will lead to an accident. The risk of an insulin overdose is probably
medium to low.

 Resilience is a system characteristic that reflects its ability to

damaging event on networked software systems is a cyberattack 
of some kind so most of the work now done in resilience is 
aimed at deterring, detecting and recovering from such attacks.

   <strong>Strategy use</strong> -- Normally, in critical systems, a mix of risk reduction 
strategies are used.
In a chemical plant control system, the system will 
include sensors to detect and correct excess pressure in 
the reactor.
However, it will also include an independent protection 
system that opens a relief valve if dangerously high 
pressure is detected.

   <strong>Structured safety arguments</strong> -- Structured arguments that demonstrate that a system 
meets its safety obligations.
It is not necessary to demonstrate that the program 
works as intended; the aim is simply to demonstrate 
safety.
Generally based on a claim hierarchy. 
 You start at the leaves of the hierarchy and demonstrate safety. 
This implies the higher&#9679;level claims are true.

Safety reviews
Driven by the hazard register.
For each identified hazrd, the review team should assess 
the system and judge whether or not the system can 
cope with that hazard in a safe way.
