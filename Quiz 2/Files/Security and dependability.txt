Security and safety 
 An attack that corrupts the system or its data means that 
analysing the source code of safety critical software and assume 
the executing code is a completely accurate translation of that 
induced and the safety case made for the software is invalid. 
Security and resilience
 Resilience is a system characteristic that reflects its ability to 
resist and recover from damaging events. The most probable 
damaging event on networked software systems is a cyberattack 
of some kind so most of the work now done in resilience is 
aimed at deterring, detecting and recovering from such attacks.
