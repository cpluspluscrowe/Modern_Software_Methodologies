Testing the extent to which the system can protect itself 
from external attacks.
 Problems with security testing
 Security requirements are ‘shall not’ requirements i.e. they 
specify what should not happen. It is not usually possible to 
define security requirements as simple constraints that can be 
checked by the system.
 The people attacking a system are intelligent and look for 
vulnerabilities. They can experiment to discover weaknesses 
and loopholes in the system.
