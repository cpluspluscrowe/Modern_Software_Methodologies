If a system is a networked system and is insecure then 
statements about its reliability and its safety are 
unreliable.
These statements depend on the executing system and 
the developed system being the same. However, 
intrusion can change the executing system and slash or its 
data.
Therefore, the reliability and safety assurance is no 
longer valid.
