Accidents in complex systems rarely have a single cause 
as these systems are designed to be resilient to a single 
point of failure
 Designing systems so that a single point of failure does not 
cause an accident is a fundamental principle of safe systems 
design.
Almost all accidents are a result of combinations of 
malfunctions rather than single failures.
It is probably the case that anticipating all problem 
combinations, especially, in software controlled systems 
is impossible so achieving complete safety is impossible. 
Accidents are inevitable.
