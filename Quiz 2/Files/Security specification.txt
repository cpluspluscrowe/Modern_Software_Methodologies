 Security specification has something in common with safety 
requirements specification –in both cases, your concern is to avoid 
something bad happening.
 Four major differences
 Safety problems are accidental –the software is not operating in a 
hostile environment. In security, you must assume that attackers have 
knowledge of system weaknesses
 When safety failures occur, you can look for the root cause or weakness 
that led to the failure. When failure results from a deliberate attack, the 
 Shutting down a system can avoid a safety-related failure. Causing a 
 Safety-related events are not generated from an intelligent adversary. 
An attacker can probe defenses over time to discover weaknesses.
