Risk avoidance requirements set out the risks that 
should be avoided by designing the system so that these 
risks simply cannot arise.
Risk detection requirements define mechanisms that 
identify the risk if it arises and neutralise the risk before 
losses occur.
Risk mitigation requirements set out how the system 
should be designed so that it can recover from and 
restore system assets after some loss has occurred.
