Design guidelines encapsulate good practice in secure 
systems design
Design guidelines serve two purposes:
 They raise awareness of security issues in a software 
engineering team. Security is considered when design decisions 
are made.
 They can be used as the basis of a review checklist that is 
applied during the system validation process. 
Design guidelines here are applicable during software 
specification and design
