The goal of safety requirements engineering is to identify 
protection requirements that ensure that system failures 
do not cause injury or death or environmental damage.
they define situations and events that should never 
occur.
Functional safety requirements define:
 Checking and recovery features that should be included in a 
system
 Features that provide protection against system failures and 
external attacks
