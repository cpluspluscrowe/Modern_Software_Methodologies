Producing a mathematical specification requires a 
detailed analysis of the requirements and this is likely to 
uncover errors.
Concurrent systems can be analysed to discover race 
conditions that might lead to deadlock. Testing for such 
problems is very difficult.
They can detect implementation errors before testing 
when the program is analyzed alongside the 
specification.
