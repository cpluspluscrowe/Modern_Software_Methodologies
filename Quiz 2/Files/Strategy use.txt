Normally, in critical systems, a mix of risk reduction 
strategies are used.
In a chemical plant control system, the system will 
include sensors to detect and correct excess pressure in 
the reactor.
However, it will also include an independent protection 
system that opens a relief valve if dangerously high 
pressure is detected.
