Modification threats that allow an attacker to tamper with 
a system asset. 
 In the Mentcare system, a modification threat would be where an 
attacker alters or destroys a patient record.
Fabrication threats that allow an attacker to insert false 
information into a system. 
 This is perhaps not a credible threat in the Mentcare system but 
would be a threat in a banking system, where false transactions 
might be added to the system that transfer money to the 
perpetrator’s bank account.
