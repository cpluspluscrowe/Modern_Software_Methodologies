Arguments are based on claims and evidence.
Insulin pump safety:
 Claim: The maximum single dose of insulin to be delivered 
(CurrentDose) will not exceed MaxDose.
 Evidence: Safety argument for insulin pump (discussed later)
 Evidence: Test data for insulin pump. The value of currentDose
 Evidence: Static analysis report for insulin pump software 
revealed no anomalies that affected the value of CurrentDose
 Argument: The evidence presented demonstrates that the 
maximum dose of insulin that can be computed = MaxDose.
