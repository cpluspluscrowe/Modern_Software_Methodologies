The aim of this initial risk assessment is to identify 
generic risks that are applicable to the system and to 
decide if an adequate level of security can be achieved 
at a reasonable cost. 
The risk assessment should focus on the identification 
and analysis of high-level risks to the system. 
The outcomes of the risk assessment process are used 
to help identify security requirements.
