 Define a security policy for the organization that sets out the 
fundamental security requirements that should apply to all 
organizational systems.
Avoid a single point of failure
 Ensure that a security failure can only result when there is more 
than one failure in security procedures. For example, have 
password and question-based authentication.
Fail securely
 When systems fail, for whatever reason, ensure that sensitive 
information cannot be accessed by unauthorized users even 
although normal security procedures are unavailable.
