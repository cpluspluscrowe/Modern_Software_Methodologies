Security policies should set out general information 
access strategies that should apply across the 
organization. 
The point of security policies is to inform everyone in an 
organization about security so these should not be long 
and detailed technical documents. 
From a security engineering perspective, the security 
policy defines, in broad terms, the security goals of the 
organization. 
The security engineering process is concerned with 
implementing these goals.
