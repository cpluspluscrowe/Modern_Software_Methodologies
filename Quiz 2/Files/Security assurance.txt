Vulnerability avoidance
 The system is designed so that vulnerabilities do not occur. For 
example, if there is no external network connection then external 
attack is impossible
Attack detection and elimination
 The system is designed so that attacks on vulnerabilities are 
detected and neutralised before they result in an exposure. For 
example, virus checkers find and remove viruses before they 
infect a system
Exposure limitation and recovery
 The system is designed so that the adverse consequences of a 
successful attack are minimised. For example, a backup policy 
allows damaged information to be restored
