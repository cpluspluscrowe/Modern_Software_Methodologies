Process assurance involves defining a dependable 
process and ensuring that this process is followed during 
the system development.
Process assurance focuses on:
 Do we have the right processes? Are the processes appropriate 
for the level of dependability required. Should include 
requirements management, change management, reviews and 
inspections, etc.
 Are we doing the processes right? Have these processes been 
followed by the development team.
Process assurance generates documentation
 Agile processes therefore are rarely used for critical systems.
