Although software failures can be safety-critical, the use 
of software control systems contributes to increased 
system safety
 Software monitoring and control allows a wider range of 
conditions to be monitored and controlled than is possible using 
electro-mechanical safety systems.
 Software control allows safety strategies to be adopted that 
reduce the amount of time people spend in hazardous 
environments.
 Software can detect and correct safety-critical operator errors.
