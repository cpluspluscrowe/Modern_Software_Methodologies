The acceptability of a risk is determined by human, 
social and political considerations.
In most societies, the boundaries between the regions 
are pushed upwards with time i.e. society is less willing 
to accept risk
Risk assessment is subjective
 Risks are identified as probable, unlikely, etc. This depends on 
who is making the assessment.
