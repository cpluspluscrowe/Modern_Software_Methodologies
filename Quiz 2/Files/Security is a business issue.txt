Security is expensive and it is important that security 
decisions are made in a cost-effective way
 There is no point in spending more than the value of an asset to 
keep that asset secure.
Organizations use a risk-based approach to support 
security decision making and should have a defined 
security policy based on security risk analysis
Security risk analysis is a business rather than a 
technical process
