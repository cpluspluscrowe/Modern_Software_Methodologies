 Try to avoid security procedures that make the system difficult to 
use. Sometimes you have to accept weaker security to make the 
system more usable.
Log user actions
 Maintain a log of user actions that can be analyzed to discover 
who did what. If users know about such a log, they are less likely 
to behave in an irresponsible way.
Use redundancy and diversity to reduce risk
 Keep multiple copies of data and use diverse infrastructure so 
that an infrastructure vulnerability cannot be the single point of 
failure.
