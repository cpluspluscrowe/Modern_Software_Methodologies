Vulnerabilities are often language-specific. 
 Array bound checking is automatic in languages like Java so this 
is not a vulnerability that can be exploited in Java programs. 
 However, millions of programs are written in C and C++ as these 
allow for the development of more efficient software so simply 
avoiding the use of these languages is not a realistic option.
Security vulnerabilities are closely related to program 
reliability. 
 Programs without array bound checking can crash so actions 
taken to improve program reliability can also improve system 
security.
