Primary safety-critical systems
 Embedded software systems whose failure can cause the 
associated hardware to fail and directly threaten people. Example 
is the insulin pump control system.
Secondary safety-critical systems
 Systems whose failure results in faults in other (socio-technical) 
systems, which can then have safety consequences. 
lead to inappropriate treatment being prescribed.
• Infrastructure control systems are also secondary safety-critical 
systems.
