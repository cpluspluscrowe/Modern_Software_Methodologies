Characteristic error checking
 The static analyzer can check for patterns in the code that are 
characteristic of errors made by programmers using a particular 
language.
User-defined error checking
 Users of a programming language define error patterns, thus 
extending the types of error that can be detected. This allows 
specific rules that apply to a program to be checked.
Assertion checking
 Developers include formal assertions in their program and 
relationships that must hold. The static analyzer symbolically 
executes the code and highlights potential problems.
