Safety and reliability are related but distinct
 In general, reliability and availability are necessary but not 
sufficient conditions for system safety 
Reliability is concerned with conformance to a given

Safety is concerned with ensuring system cannot cause 
damage irrespective of whether or not it conforms to its 
specification.
 System reliability is essential for safety but is not enough
 Reliable systems can be unsafe
