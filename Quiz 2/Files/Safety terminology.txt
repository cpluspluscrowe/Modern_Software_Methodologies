Term Definition
Accident (or mishap) An unplanned event or sequence of events which results in human death or injury,
damage to property, or to the environment. An overdose of insulin is an example of an
accident.
Hazard A condition with the potential for causing or contributing to an accident. A failure of the
sensor that measures blood glucose is an example of a hazard.
Damage A measure of the loss resulting from a mishap. Damage can range from many people
being killed as a result of an accident to minor injury or property damage. Damage
resulting from an overdose of insulin could be serious injury or the death of the user of
the insulin pump.
Hazard severity An assessment of the worst possible damage that could result from a particular hazard.
Hazard severity can range from catastrophic, where many people are killed, to minor,
where only minor damage results. When an individual death is a possibility, a
reasonable assessment of hazard severity is ‘very high’.
Hazard probability The probability of the events occurring which create a hazard. Probability values tend to
‘implausible’ (no conceivable situations are likely in which the hazard could occur). The
probability of a sensor failure in the insulin pump that results in an overdose is probably
low.
Risk This is a measure of the probability that the system will cause an accident. The risk is
assessed by considering the hazard probability, the hazard severity, and the probability
that the hazard will lead to an accident. The risk of an insulin overdose is probably
medium to low.
