Establish the safe exit conditions for a component or a 
program.
Starting from the END of the code, work backwards until 
you have identified all paths that lead to the exit of the 
code.
Assume that the exit condition is false.
Show that, for each path leading to the exit that the 
assignments made in that path contradict the 
assumption of an unsafe exit from the component.
