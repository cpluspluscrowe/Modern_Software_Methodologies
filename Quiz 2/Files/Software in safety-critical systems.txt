decisions made by the software and subsequent actions 
are safety-critical. Therefore, the software behaviour is 
directly related to the overall safety of the system. 
Software is extensively used for checking and monitoring 
other safety-critical components in a system. For 
example, all aircraft engine components are monitored 
by software looking for early indications of component 
failure. This software is safety-critical because, if it fails,
