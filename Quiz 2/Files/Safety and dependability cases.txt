Safety and dependability cases are structured 
documents that set out detailed arguments and evidence 
that a required level of safety or dependability has been 
achieved.
They are normally required by regulators before a 
system can be certified for operational use. The 
regulator’s responsibility is to check that a system is as 
safe or dependable as is practical.
Regulators and developers work together and negotiate 
what needs to be included in a system 
safety slash dependability case.
