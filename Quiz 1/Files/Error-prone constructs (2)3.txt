1.	Unconditional branch goto statements
2.	Floating point numbers (inherently imprecise with invalid comparisons) 
3.	Pointers referencing the wrong memory can cause corrupt data
4.	Dyamic memory allocation might cause memory overflow
Object may not be deleted if you throw an exception. 
5.	Parallelism -> can result in subtle timing errors due to unforeseen interaction between parallel processes
6.	Recursion -> can cause memory overflow as the stack fills up
7.	Interrupts – signal that might cause a critical operation to be interrupted
8.	Code is not localized.  This can result in unexpected behavior.
