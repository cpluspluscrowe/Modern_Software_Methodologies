- Triple-modular redundancy (TMR).
- Three replicated identical components 
	 Receive the same input and their outputs are compared.
- One different output 
	 Ignored based on the assumption of component failure.
- Most faults caused by component failures 
	 A low probability of simultaneous component failure.
