- Software diversity is difficult to achieve because it is 
practically impossible to ensure that each version of the 
software is truly independent.
- Dependable programming relies on including 
redundancy in a program as checks on the validity of 
inputs and the values of program variables.
- Statistical testing is used to estimate software reliability. 
It relies on testing the system with test data that matches 
an operational profile, which reflects the distribution of 
inputs to the software when it is in use.
