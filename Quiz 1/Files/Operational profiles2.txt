1.	A set of test data freque. Matches normal usage & number of times the failure event occurred
2.	Close match with actual usage reflect actual usage
3.	Generated from real data
Think geometric distrubtion
1.	Automatic data generation
2.	Difficult to generate unlikely inputs and anomalies and test for these
3.	Unknown usage pattern of a new system
4.	Changeable operational profiles
a.	Non-static, but dynamic 
b.	Learn about new systems, changing usage patterns
