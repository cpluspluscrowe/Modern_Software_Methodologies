Dynamic binding with inheritance can be crazy.  
Asliasing : more than 1 name to refer to the same state variable
Unbounded arrays: buffer overflow failures
Default input processing – malicious inputs trigger failures
Provide restart capabilities – after long transactions
Developers often write programs which address memory locations outside of array bounds
Name all constants that represent real-world values
	Do not use numeric values, always refer to them by name
Reduce mistakes for wrong values by using a name rather than a value
