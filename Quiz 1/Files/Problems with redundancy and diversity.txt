- Adding diversity and redundancy increases complexity.
- Increase the chances of error 
	 Unanticipated interactions between redundant components.
- Advocate simplicity to decrease software dependability.
	 E.g., an Airbus product is redundant slash diverse; a Boeing product 
has no software diversity
