- Operational profile uncertainty
	 Inaccurate operational profile that does not reflect the real use of 
the system.
- High costs of test data generation
	 Expensive costs to generate test datasets for the system.
- Statistical uncertainty
	 A statistically significant number of failures for computation.
	 Highly reliable systems rarely fail.
- Recognizing failure
	 Conflicting interpretations of a specification about unobvious 
failures.
