- Automatic data generation, if possible.
	 Difficult for interactive systems.
	 Easy for ‘normal’ inputs 
- Difficult to generate ‘unlikely’ inputs (anomalies) and test 
data for these anomalies.
- Unknown usage pattern of new systems.
- Changeable operational profiles 
	 Non-static but dynamic
	 E.g., learn about new systems, changing usage patterns.
