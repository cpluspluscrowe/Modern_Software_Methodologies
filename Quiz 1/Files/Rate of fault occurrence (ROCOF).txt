- System failure occurrence rate
- ROCOF of 0.002 
- Reliable systems needed
	 Systems perform a number of similar requests in a short time
	 E.g., credit card processing system.
- Reciprocal of ROCOF is Mean time to Failure (MTTF)
	 Systems with long transactions
	 System processing takes a long time. MTTF is longer than expected 
transaction length.
