- Verification-based approaches
	 Different representations of a software system are proved to be 
equivalent. 
	 Demonstrate the absence of errors.
- Refinement-based approaches
	 A system representation is transformed into a lower-level 
representation.
	 Correct transformation results in equivalent representations.
