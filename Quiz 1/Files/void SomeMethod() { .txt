Error-prone constructs
- Parallelism
	 Can result in subtle timing errors because of unforeseen 
interaction between parallel processes.
- Recursion
	 Errors in recursion can cause memory overflow as the 
program stack fills up.
- Interrupts
	 Interrupts can cause a critical operation to be terminated 
and make a program difficult to understand.  
- Inheritance
	 Code is not localised. This can result in unexpected 
behaviour when changes are made and problems of 
understanding the code.
