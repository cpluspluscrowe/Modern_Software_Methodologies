Insulin pump control system
² Collects data from a blood sugar sensor and calculates 
the amount of insulin required to be injected.
² Calculation based on the rate of change of blood sugar 
levels.
Insulin pump control system (cont.)
² Sends signals to a micro-pump to deliver the correct 
dose of insulin.
² Safety-critical system as low blood sugars can lead to 
brain malfunctioning, coma and death; high-blood sugar 
levels have long-term consequences such as eye and 
kidney damage.

Safety terminology
Term Definition
Accident (or mishap)
An unplanned event or sequence of events which results in human death or injury,
damage to property, or to the environment. An overdose of insulin is an example of an
accident.
Hazard A condition with the potential for causing or contributing to an accident. A failure of the
sensor that measures blood glucose is an example of a hazard.
Damage
A measure of the loss resulting from a mishap. Damage can range from many people
being killed as a result of an accident to minor injury or property damage. Damage
resulting from an overdose of insulin could be serious injury or the death of the user of
the insulin pump.
Hazard severity
An assessment of the worst possible damage that could result from a particular hazard.
Hazard severity can range from catastrophic, where many people are killed, to minor,
where only minor damage results. When an individual death is a possibility, a
reasonable assessment of hazard severity is ‘very high’.
Hazard probability
The probability of the events occurring which create a hazard. Probability values tend to
be arbitrary but range from ‘probable’ (say 1/100 chance of a hazard occurring) to
‘implausible’ (no conceivable situations are likely in which the hazard could occur). The
probability of a sensor failure in the insulin pump that results in an overdose is probably
low.
Risk
This is a measure of the probability that the system will cause an accident. The risk is
assessed by considering the hazard probability, the hazard severity, and the probability
that the hazard will lead to an accident. The risk of an insulin overdose is probably
medium to low.

Normal accidents
² Rarely have a single cause in complex systems 
² Designed to be resilient to a single point of failure
² A fundamental principle of safe systems design
§ A single point of failure does not cause an accident.
² A result of combinations of malfunctions.
² Hard to anticipate all combinations in software systems
§ Difficult to achieve complete safety.
§ Accidents are inevitable.
